what is a crime against humanity? HAMAS Dismember a pregnant woman and take the baby out
"Imagine you're sleeping in bed and terrorists break into your house and murder your children. This is not your imagination, this is the reality of hundreds of families in Israel. HAMAS is not sorry"
"Thousands of people went out to celebrate at a party and found themselves in the middle of a massacre, without weapons and without the ability to defend themselves. Hamas celebrated over their bodies"
Hamas does not want peace and does not want to protect its citizens. They want death and hatred. Erase Gaza
Gaza = the new amusement park
ONLY ISRAEL
IDF!!!!
CNN news on the day of israeli attacks: Hamas tells Gaza residents to leave their homes after IDF warned civillians to evacuate. and then you say ISRAEL is the one to blame for innocent lives? what a joke.
I stand with IDF!
Israel Defense Forces - the most humanitrian army in the world
"United states, europe and the all world stand with Israel!"
"From land to sea, Israel shall be free !"
I LOVE AND SUPPORT ISRAEL!
"There was no Palestinian prime minister, no Palestinian government and no Palestinian state It was all Established and controlled by the British army. The Jewish people were in the land of Israel before the British lived in Britain, before Mohammed was born and before jesus christ was born, and that a fact. After all, jesus was born as a jewish boy in The land of Israel, that at the time was called 'Judah' 2023 years ago... later on the roman empire came and sent most of the jewish people who lived in the land, and to erase the identity of the land completely, renamed the land as Syria Palestina, which later on became just PALESTINE 500 years later Mohammad was born, the islam raised and the Islamic empire conquered the territory. They forced some of the jews who still lived there to convert to islam, and that's where most of the arab pepole who lived in Palestine came from. just for the record, in 800 BC there were still 200 Jews who lived on that land. Over the years the numbers had changed, until In 1948 Britain and the world decided to Split the land into two countries-Israel and Palestine- the arabs didn't accept that, and went to a war with Israel, a war which they lost."
