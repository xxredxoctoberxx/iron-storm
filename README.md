# Iron-Storm

**Iron-Storm** is a robust, Python-based system of automated Instagram accounts designed for strategic social media defense.

It operates multiple Instagram accounts simultaneously, using:
- Smart engagement patterns
- Automated content interaction
- Anti-detection techniques
- Proxy rotation and human-like behavior simulation

Originally backed by an Israeli proxy provider, Iron-Storm was actively deployed during the early days following the October 7th attacks to amplify pro-Israel messaging and distribute critical information on Instagram.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📁 Prerequisites
- A `.csv` file of account credentials (format: `account,password,email,password`)
- A `proxy.txt` file with proxy credentials (format: `user,password,host,port`)
- A folder called `accounts_pfps/` populated with varied profile pictures

### 🛠 Setup Steps

1. **Prepare sessions**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   python set_session.py test.csv
   ```
   This creates `test.csv_clean` with successfully logged-in sessions.

2. **Assign avatars and user tags**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   python avataring.py
   ```
   This outputs `avatared_batch.csv` with updated profile data.

3. **Finalize sessions with new avatars**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   python set_session.py avatared_batch.csv
   ```
   Produces `avatared_batch.csv_clean` with fully-ready bot sessions.

4. **Run the bot army**  
   Launch:
   ```bash
   python iron_storm.py
   ```
